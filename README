Meteorocks is an Asteroids clone, being programmed in XNA. Help with sprites,
backgrounds and stuff are welcome.

For now, all the game has is a ship which translates and rotates through the
screen, shoots useless bullets and a bunch of meteors which appears randomly.

===================================================================================
PLANNED FEATURES
===================================================================================

1. Scores
2. More then one life
3. A Game Over Screen

===================================================================================
FEATURES
===================================================================================

1. A fire animation for the ship's rockets
2. Bullets
3. Meteors

===================================================================================
KNOWN ISSUES
===================================================================================

1. The bullet doesn't destroy the meteor if it's on the other side of the screen,
but appears on the same size

===================================================================================
PLANNED SOFTWARE DESIGN CHANGES
===================================================================================

1. A more generic InputHandle, which will accept easily different types of
controllers (I'm planning a interface which each input handle will implement).
2. A "Sprite" superclass, which every object in the game will implement
3. A "Ship" superclass, which will have different children, each representing a
different type of spaceship.
