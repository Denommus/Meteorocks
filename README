Meteorocks is an Asteroids clone, being programmed in XNA. Help with sprites, backgrounds and stuff are welcome.

For now, all the game has is a ship which translates and rotates through the screen, shoots useless bullets and a bunch of meteors which appears randomly..

===================================================================================
PLANNED FEATURES
===================================================================================

1. A fire animation for the ship's rockets
2. Bullets
3. Meteors

===================================================================================
PLANNED SOFTWARE DESIGN CHANGES
===================================================================================

1. A more generic InputHandle, which will accept easily different types of controllers (I'm planning a interface which each input handle will implement).
2. A "Sprite" superclass, which every object in the game will implement
3. A "Ship" superclass, which will have different children, each representing a different type of spaceship.
